This is my implementation of the game 2048 using Java Swing, a popular game where the aim is to get to the tile 2048 by combining identically-numbered tiles together.  

Controls: \
Use the arrow keys to shift tiles in all 4 directions

Game Features: 
1. The game stores the personal bests of the player (their lowest number of moves to get to 2048 and their highest score).  
2. Players can undo their moves, and the state of the game will be updated each time a user makes a move or undoes a move.  
3. Players have an option to load their progress when running the game.

Java Features Implemented:
1. 2D Arrays
2. Collections (Linked List, Maps)
3. File I/O
4. JUnit Testing

Run the Game: 
```
cd src
Java Game.java
```
